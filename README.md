The dataset contains details of registered electric vehicles, including:
- VIN
- Model Year
- Make & Model
- Electric Vehicle Type
- Electric Range
- CAFV Eligibility
- County and Location

## Steps / Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, zero Electric Range, anonymized VINs, and extracted GPS coordinates.  
2. **Exploration:** Identified top EV makes and models, county-wise distribution, adoption trends by model year, and CAFV eligibility.  
3. **Visualization:** Created bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and geospatial plots for better insights.  

## Key Insights
- Tesla is the most common EV make.  
- EV adoption has increased significantly in recent years.  
- Electric Range varies by make and model, with newer vehicles showing higher ranges.  
- Urban counties show higher EV registrations compared to rural counties.
